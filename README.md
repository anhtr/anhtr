### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anh Tran and I'm currently a data analyst at the American Academy of Dermatology. In my free time, I am also a freelance data consultant and open-source R developer. I have been working with R since 2017, with focus on bioinformatics, data visualization and package writing.

- I'm the author of the Bioconductor [HPAanalyze package](https://github.com/trannhatanh89/HPAanalyze), and currently working on a [R Shiny version](https://github.com/anhtr/HPAanalyzeShiny).
- I'm currently learning how to use Python, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS and advanced R Shiny.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data visualization. I'm open to freelance data analysis and visualization jobs, and will consider working pro bono for certain non-profits.

Some of my past projects:

- Glioblastoma patients with extreme BMI changes and their hospital visit patterns: A visualization of i2b2 data from University of Alabama at Birmingham. Finalist in the 2018 i2b2 Abstract Contest.
- [Meningiomics](http://meningiomics.northwestern.edu/): I conceptualized and did some ground work for this Shiny web app allowing analysis of publicly available data. [Kaitlyn O'Shea](https://github.com/kaitlu/MeningiOMICS) is the current developer of this project.
- R package contribution: [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr), [volcanoPlot](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/volcanoPlot).
