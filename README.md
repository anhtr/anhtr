### Greetings ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anh Tran and I'm a data analyst at the American Academy of Dermatology. In addition to my full-time job, I am also a freelance data consultant and R developer. I have been working with R since 2017, with a focus on bioinformatics, clinical data, visualization and dashboard creation, and package development.

- I'm the author of the Bioconductor [HPAanalyze package](https://github.com/trannhatanh89/HPAanalyze), and currently working on an R Shiny and a Python version.
- I'm actively learning new skills such as Python, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, and advanced R Shiny.
- I'm looking to collaborate on exciting data visualization projects and open to freelance data analysis and visualization work. I have a passion for using my skills to help non-profit organizations and have completed pro bono work for such organizations in the past.
- You can reach me at trannhatanh89 (at) gmail (dot) com
- Pronouns: he/him

Some of my other projects include:
- A visualization of i2b2 data from University of Alabama at Birmingham on Glioblastoma patients with extreme BMI changes and their hospital visit patterns. This project was a finalist in the 2018 i2b2 Abstract Contest.
- [Meningiomics](http://meningiomics.northwestern.edu/): I conceptualized and did the initial groundwork for this Shiny web app that allows for analysis of publicly available data. [Kaitlyn O'Shea](https://github.com/kaitlu/MeningiOMICS) is the current developer of this project.
- Contributions to R packages such as [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) and [volcanoPlot](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/volcanoPlot).
